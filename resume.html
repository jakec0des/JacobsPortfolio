                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm Jacob!

                        I am a <span class="bolded">student software developer</span> with a passion for creating <span
                            class="bolded">web applications</span> and solving technical problems. I am currently
                        pursuing an education in <span class="bolded">Computer Programming</span> at <span
                            class="bolded">Algonquin College</span>, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and
                        gaining hands-on experience in real-life situations.

                        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering
                        principles and gained proficiency in several programming languages such as <span
                            class="bolded">Java, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS</span>. I have also delved into data
                        structures and acquired practical knowledge in <span class="bolded">SQL</span>.

                        Beyond my technical skills, I am a proactive and dedicated individual constantly seeking
                        personal and professional growth opportunities. With excellent problem-solving abilities and
                        effective communication skills, I thrive in collaborative team environments and value the power
                        of collective expertise.
                        <br><br>
                        I am particularly interested in securing a challenging <span class="bolded">co-op</span>
                        placement in a high-quality engineering environment starting in <span class="bolded">January
                            2024</span>. My goal is to work on exciting projects, learn from experienced professionals,
                        and contribute my skills to make a meaningful impact.
